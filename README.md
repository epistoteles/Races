## 🤔 What?

This repository is a submission for the code competition 'BIG DATA Predictions' by [Materna](https://www.materna.com/EN/Home/home_node.html).

Learn more about the competition here: https://it-talents.de/veranstaltung/code-competition-12-2021-big-data-predictions/ (German)

The task is to clean, understand and create useful insights from a messy dataset of 166,000 records from an online racing game.


## ⚙️ Installation

The submission file is the notebook `Report.ipynb`. 

It has been beautified using [jupyter-themes](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes). If you want it to look as nice as intended, execute the following commands *before* starting Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyterthemes
```

```
jt -t grade3 -fs 10 -altp -nfs 115 -nf georgiaserif -tfs 115 -tf opensans -m 200 -cellw 70%
```

If you don't just want to read the notebook, but execute its cells yourself, all requirements in `requirements.txt` have to be installed. You don't have to do this manually! Just execute the installation cell at the top of notebook after starting it - you should execute the notebook from top to bottom anyway.

This assumes you have Python 3 and Jupyter already installed, of course.

Finally, open the notebook:

```
jupyter notebook Report.ipynb
```
